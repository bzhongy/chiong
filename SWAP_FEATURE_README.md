# Swap Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a swap button to the "Pay with" section that allows users to swap between different assets (WETH/CBBTC to USDC) using the existing Kyber integration.

## Features

### 1. Swap Button
- Located below the payment asset selection buttons
- Text changes contextually:
  - "Swap Assets" when USDC is selected
  - "Swap to USDC" when WETH or CBBTC is selected

### 2. Swap Modal
- Opens when the swap button is clicked
- Allows users to select:
  - **From Asset**: WETH or CBBTC
  - **To Asset**: USDC (fixed)
  - **Amount**: User input with quick amount buttons (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0)

### 3. Real-time Calculations
- Uses existing Kyber API integration
- Shows swap rate in real-time
- Displays output amount as user types
- Shows balance information for selected assets

### 4. User Experience
- Loading states during calculations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Form validation
- Quick amount selection buttons
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **app.html** - Added swap button and modal HTML
2. **app.css** - Added styling for swap components
3. **ui_interactions.js** - Added swap functionality and event handlers

### Key Functions
- `setupSwapModalListeners()` - Sets up event listeners for the swap modal
- `openSwapModal()` - Opens and initializes the swap modal
- `updateSwapCalculations()` - Calculates swap rates using Kyber API
- `executeSwap()` - Handles swap execution (currently demo mode)
- `updateSwapFromBalance()` - Updates balance display for selected asset

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `kyberSwap.getQuote()` function
- Integrates with existing `CONFIG.collateralMap` for token addresses
- Works with existing wallet connection state
- Updates payment asset balance displays after swaps

## Usage

### For Users
1. Select a payment asset (WETH or CBBTC)
2. Click the "Swap to USDC" button
3. Enter the amount you want to swap
4. View real-time swap rates and output amounts
5. Click "Execute Swap" to proceed

### For Developers
The swap functionality is modular and can be easily extended:
- Add new token pairs by updating the asset selection dropdowns
- Integrate with actual swap execution by modifying `executeSwap()`
- Add additional validation or approval steps
- Customize the UI styling through CSS variables

## Current Limitations
- **Demo Mode**: The execute swap function currently shows a success message instead of executing actual transactions
- **Fixed Destination**: Currently only supports swapping TO USDC (can be extended)
- **Single Chain**: Currently configured for Base chain (CHAIN_ID: 8453)

## Future Enhancements
- Actual swap execution through Kyber contracts
- Support for swapping between any two assets
- Multi-chain support
- Transaction history and status tracking
- Slippage protection settings
- Gas optimization options

## Testing
To test the swap functionality:
1. Ensure the app is running with wallet connected
2. Select a non-USDC payment asset
3. Click the swap button
4. Enter amounts and verify calculations
5. Test error scenarios (disconnect wallet, invalid amounts, etc.)

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap 5.2.3 (for modal functionality)
- Ethers.js 5.6.9 (for token formatting)
- Existing Kyber integration
- jQuery (for DOM manipulation)
